# ERB -- Ruby Templating

## Introduction

ERB provides an easy to use but powerful templating system for Ruby.  Using
ERB, actual Ruby code can be added to any plain text document for the purposes
of generating document information details and/or flow control.

A very simple example is this:

    require 'erb'

    x = 42
    template = ERB.new <<-EOF
      The value of x is: <%= x %>
    EOF
    puts template.result(binding)

*Prints:* The value of x is: 42

More complex examples are given below.

## Recognized Tags

ERB recognizes certain tags in the provided template and converts them based
on the rules below:

    <% Ruby code -- inline with output %>
    <%= Ruby expression -- replace with result %>
    <%# comment -- ignored -- useful in testing %> (`<% #` doesn't work. Don't use Ruby comments.)
    % a line of Ruby code -- treated as <% line %> (optional -- see ERB.new)
    %% replaced with % if first thing on a line and % processing is used
    <%% or %%> -- replace with <% or %> respectively

All other text is passed through ERB filtering unchanged.

## Options

There are several settings you can change when you use ERB:
*   the nature of the tags that are recognized;
*   the binding used to resolve local variables in the template.

See the ERB.new and ERB#result methods for more detail.

## Character encodings

ERB (or Ruby code generated by ERB) returns a string in the same character
encoding as the input string.  When the input string has a magic comment,
however, it returns a string in the encoding specified by the magic comment.

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    require 'erb'

    template = ERB.new <<EOF
    <%#-*- coding: Big5 -*-%>
      \_\_ENCODING\_\_ is <%= \_\_ENCODING\_\_ %>.
    EOF
    puts template.result

*Prints:* _*ENCODING*_ is Big5.

## Examples

### Plain Text

ERB is useful for any generic templating situation.  Note that in this
example, we use the convenient "% at start of line" tag, and we quote the
template literally with `%q{...}` to avoid trouble with the backslash.

    require "erb"

    # Create template.
    template = %q{
      From:  James Edward Gray II <james@grayproductions.net>
      To:  <%= to %>
      Subject:  Addressing Needs

      <%= to[/\w+/] %>:

      Just wanted to send a quick note assuring that your needs are being
      addressed.

      I want you to know that my team will keep working on the issues,
      especially:

      <%# ignore numerous minor requests -- focus on priorities %>
      % priorities.each do |priority|
        * <%= priority %>
      % end

      Thanks for your patience.

    }.gsub(/^  /, '')

    message = ERB.new(template, trim_mode: "%<>")

    # Set up template data.
    to = "Community Spokesman <spokesman@ruby_community.org>"
    priorities = [ "Run Ruby Quiz",
                   "Document Modules",
                   "Answer Questions on Ruby Talk" ]

    # Produce result.
    email = message.result
    puts email

*Generates:*

    From:  James Edward Gray II <james@grayproductions.net>
    To:  Community Spokesman <spokesman@ruby_community.org>
    Subject:  Addressing Needs

    Community:

### Ruby in HTML

ERB is often used in `.rhtml` files (HTML with embedded Ruby).  Notice the
need in this example to provide a special binding when the template is run, so
that the instance variables in the Product object can be resolved.

    require "erb"

    # Build template data class.
    class Product
      def initialize( code, name, desc, cost )
        @code = code
        @name = name
        @desc = desc
        @cost = cost

        @features = [ ]
      end

      def add_feature( feature )
        @features << feature
      end

      # Support templating of member data.
      def get_binding
        binding
      end

      # ...
    end

    # Create template.
    template = %{
      <html>
        <head><title>Ruby Toys -- <%= @name %></title></head>
        <body>

          <h1><%= @name %> (<%= @code %>)</h1>
          <p><%= @desc %></p>

          <ul>
            <% @features.each do |f| %>
              <li><b><%= f %></b></li>
            <% end %>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <% if @cost < 10 %>
              <b>Only <%= @cost %>!!!</b>
            <% else %>
               Call for a price, today!
            <% end %>
          </p>

        </body>
      </html>
    }.gsub(/^  /, '')

    rhtml = ERB.new(template)

    # Set up template data.
    toy = Product.new( "TZ-1002",
                       "Rubysapien",
                       "Geek's Best Friend!  Responds to Ruby commands...",
                       999.95 )
    toy.add_feature("Listens for verbal commands in the Ruby language!")
    toy.add_feature("Ignores Perl, Java, and all C variants.")
    toy.add_feature("Karate-Chop Action!!!")
    toy.add_feature("Matz signature on left leg.")
    toy.add_feature("Gem studded eyes... Rubies, of course!")

    # Produce result.
    rhtml.run(toy.get_binding)

*Generates (some blank lines removed):*

    <html>
      <head><title>Ruby Toys -- Rubysapien</title></head>
      <body>

        <h1>Rubysapien (TZ-1002)</h1>
        <p>Geek's Best Friend!  Responds to Ruby commands...</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Listens for verbal commands in the Ruby language!</b></li>
            <li><b>Ignores Perl, Java, and all C variants.</b></li>
            <li><b>Karate-Chop Action!!!</b></li>
            <li><b>Matz signature on left leg.</b></li>
            <li><b>Gem studded eyes... Rubies, of course!</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
             Call for a price, today!
        </p>

      </body>
    </html>

## Notes

There are a variety of templating solutions available in various Ruby
projects. For example, RDoc, distributed with Ruby, uses its own template
engine, which can be reused elsewhere.

Other popular engines could be found in the corresponding
[Category](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/template_engines) of The
Ruby Toolbox.


# Class Methods
## version() [](#method-c-version)
Returns revision information for the erb.rb module.
# Attributes
## encoding[RW] [](#attribute-i-encoding)
The encoding to eval

## filename[RW] [](#attribute-i-filename)
The optional *filename* argument passed to Kernel#eval when the ERB code is
run

## lineno[RW] [](#attribute-i-lineno)
The optional *lineno* argument passed to Kernel#eval when the ERB code is run

## src[RW] [](#attribute-i-src)
The Ruby code generated by ERB


#Instance Methods
## def_class(superklassObject, methodname'result') [](#method-i-def_class)
Define unnamed class which has *methodname* as instance method, and return it.

example:
    class MyClass_
      def initialize(arg1, arg2)
        @arg1 = arg1;  @arg2 = arg2
      end
    end
    filename = 'example.rhtml'  # @arg1 and @arg2 are used in example.rhtml
    erb = ERB.new(File.read(filename))
    erb.filename = filename
    MyClass = erb.def_class(MyClass_, 'render()')
    print MyClass.new('foo', 123).render()

## def_method(mod, methodname, fname'(ERB)') [](#method-i-def_method)
Define *methodname* as instance method of *mod* from compiled Ruby source.

example:
    filename = 'example.rhtml'   # 'arg1' and 'arg2' are used in example.rhtml
    erb = ERB.new(File.read(filename))
    erb.def_method(MyClass, 'render(arg1, arg2)', filename)
    print MyClass.new.render('foo', 123)

## def_module(methodname'erb') [](#method-i-def_module)
Create unnamed module, define *methodname* as instance method of it, and
return it.

example:
    filename = 'example.rhtml'   # 'arg1' and 'arg2' are used in example.rhtml
    erb = ERB.new(File.read(filename))
    erb.filename = filename
    MyModule = erb.def_module('render(arg1, arg2)')
    class MyClass
      include MyModule
    end

## initialize(str, safe_levelNOT_GIVEN, legacy_trim_modeNOT_GIVEN, legacy_eoutvarNOT_GIVEN, trim_mode:nil, eoutvar:'_erbout') [](#method-i-initialize)
Constructs a new ERB object with the template specified in *str*.

An ERB object works by building a chunk of Ruby code that will output the
completed template when run.

If *trim_mode* is passed a String containing one or more of the following
modifiers, ERB will adjust its code generation as listed:

    %  enables Ruby code processing for lines beginning with %
    <> omit newline for lines starting with <% and ending in %>
    >  omit newline for lines ending in %>
    -  omit blank lines ending in -%>

*eoutvar* can be used to set the name of the variable ERB will build up its
output in.  This is useful when you need to run multiple ERB templates through
the same binding and/or when you want to control where output ends up.  Pass
the name of the variable to be used inside a String.

### Example

    require "erb"

    # build data class
    class Listings
      PRODUCT = { :name => "Chicken Fried Steak",
                  :desc => "A well messaged pattie, breaded and fried.",
                  :cost => 9.95 }

      attr_reader :product, :price

      def initialize( product = "", price = "" )
        @product = product
        @price = price
      end

      def build
        b = binding
        # create and run templates, filling member data variables
        ERB.new(<<~'END_PRODUCT', trim_mode: "", eoutvar: "@product").result b
          <%= PRODUCT[:name] %>
          <%= PRODUCT[:desc] %>
        END_PRODUCT
        ERB.new(<<~'END_PRICE', trim_mode: "", eoutvar: "@price").result b
          <%= PRODUCT[:name] %> -- <%= PRODUCT[:cost] %>
          <%= PRODUCT[:desc] %>
        END_PRICE
      end
    end

    # setup template data
    listings = Listings.new
    listings.build

    puts listings.product + "\n" + listings.price

*Generates*

    Chicken Fried Steak
    A well massaged pattie, breaded and fried.

    Chicken Fried Steak -- 9.95
    A well massaged pattie, breaded and fried.

**@return** [ERB] a new instance of ERB

## location=(filename, lineno) [](#method-i-location=)
Sets optional filename and line number that will be used in ERB code
evaluation and error reporting. See also #filename= and #lineno=

    erb = ERB.new('<%= some_x %>')
    erb.render
    # undefined local variable or method `some_x'
    #   from (erb):1

    erb.location = ['file.erb', 3]
    # All subsequent error reporting would use new location
    erb.render
    # undefined local variable or method `some_x'
    #   from file.erb:4

## make_compiler(trim_mode) [](#method-i-make_compiler)
Creates a new compiler for ERB.  See ERB::Compiler.new for details

## result(b) [](#method-i-result)
Executes the generated ERB code to produce a completed template, returning the
results of that code.

*b* accepts a Binding object which is used to set the context of code
evaluation.

## result_with_hash(hash) [](#method-i-result_with_hash)
Render a template on a new toplevel binding with local variables specified by
a Hash object.

## run(bnew_toplevel) [](#method-i-run)
Generate results and print them. (see ERB#result)

## set_eoutvar(compiler, eoutvar'_erbout') [](#method-i-set_eoutvar)
Can be used to set *eoutvar* as described in ERB::new.  It's probably easier
to just use the constructor though, since calling this method requires the
setup of an ERB *compiler* object.
