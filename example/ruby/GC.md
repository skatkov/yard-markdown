# Module: GC
    

The GC module provides an interface to Ruby's mark-and-sweep garbage
collection mechanism.

    Some of the underlying methods are also available via the ObjectSpace module.

    You may obtain information about the operation of the \GC through GC::Profiler.


# Class Methods
## auto_compact(*args ) [](#method-c-auto_compact)
Returns whether or not automatic compaction has been enabled.
**@overload** [] 

## auto_compact=(*args ) [](#method-c-auto_compact=)
Updates automatic compaction mode.

When enabled, the compactor will execute on every major collection.

Enabling compaction will degrade performance on major collections.
**@overload** [] 

## compact(*args ) [](#method-c-compact)
This function compacts objects together in Ruby's heap. It eliminates unused
space (or fragmentation) in the heap by moving objects in to that unused
space.

The returned `hash` contains statistics about the objects that were moved; see
GC.latest_compact_info.

This method is only expected to work on CRuby.

To test whether GC compaction is supported, use the idiom:

    GC.respond_to?(:compact)
**@overload** [] 

## config(hash nil) [](#method-c-config)
call-seq:
    GC.config -> hash
    GC.config(hash) -> hash

Sets or gets information about the current GC config.

Configuration parameters are GC implementation-specific and may change without
notice.

This method can be called without parameters to retrieve the current config as
a `Hash` with `Symbol` keys.

This method can also be called with a `Hash` argument to assign values to
valid config keys. Config keys missing from the passed `Hash` will be left
unmodified.

If a key/value pair is passed to this function that does not correspond to a
valid config key for the GC implementation being used, no config will be
updated, the key will be present in the returned Hash, and its value will be
`nil`. This is to facilitate easy migration between GC implementations.

In both call-seqs, the return value of `GC.config` will be a `Hash` containing
the most recent full configuration, i.e., all keys and values defined by the
specific GC implementation being used. In the case of a config update, the
return value will include the new values being updated.

This method is only expected to work on CRuby.

### GC Implementation independent values

The `GC.config` hash can also contain keys that are global and read-only.
These keys are not specific to any one GC library implementation and
attempting to write to them will raise `ArgumentError`.

There is currently only one global, read-only key:

implementation
:   Returns a `String` containing the name of the currently loaded GC library,
    if one has been loaded using `RUBY_GC_LIBRARY`, and "default" in all other
    cases


### GC Implementation specific values

GC libraries are expected to document their own configuration. Valid keys for
Ruby's default GC implementation are:

rgengc_allow_full_mark
:   Controls whether the GC is allowed to run a full mark (young & old
    objects).

    When `true`, GC interleaves major and minor collections. This is the
    default. GC will function as intended.

    When `false`, the GC will never trigger a full marking cycle unless
    explicitly requested by user code. Instead, only a minor mark will
    runâ€”only young objects will be marked. When the heap space is exhausted,
    new pages will be allocated immediately instead of running a full mark.

    A flag will be set to notify that a full mark has been requested. This
    flag is accessible using `GC.latest_gc_info(:needs_major_by)`

    The user can trigger a major collection at any time using
    `GC.start(full_mark: true)`

    When `false`, Young to Old object promotion is disabled. For performance
    reasons, it is recommended to warm up an application using
    `Process.warmup` before setting this parameter to `false`.

## count() [](#method-c-count)
call-seq:
    GC.count -> Integer

Returns the number of times GC has occurred since the process started.
## disable() [](#method-c-disable)
call-seq:
    GC.disable -> true or false

Disables garbage collection, returning `true` if garbage collection was
already disabled.

    GC.disable   #=> false
    GC.disable   #=> true
## enable() [](#method-c-enable)
call-seq:
    GC.enable -> true or false

Enables garbage collection, returning `true` if garbage collection was
previously disabled.

    GC.disable   #=> false
    GC.enable    #=> true
    GC.enable    #=> false
## latest_compact_info(*args ) [](#method-c-latest_compact_info)
Returns information about object moved in the most recent GC compaction.

The returned `hash` contains the following keys:

considered
:   Hash containing the type of the object as the key and the number of
    objects of that type that were considered for movement.

moved
:   Hash containing the type of the object as the key and the number of
    objects of that type that were actually moved.

moved_up
:   Hash containing the type of the object as the key and the number of
    objects of that type that were increased in size.

moved_down
:   Hash containing the type of the object as the key and the number of
    objects of that type that were decreased in size.


Some objects can't be moved (due to pinning) so these numbers can be used to
calculate compaction efficiency.
**@overload** [] 

## latest_gc_info(hash_or_key nil) [](#method-c-latest_gc_info)
call-seq:
    GC.latest_gc_info -> hash
    GC.latest_gc_info(hash) -> hash
    GC.latest_gc_info(key) -> value

Returns information about the most recent garbage collection.

If the argument `hash` is given and is a Hash object, it is overwritten and
returned. This is intended to avoid the probe effect.

If the argument `key` is given and is a Symbol object, it returns the value
associated with the key. This is equivalent to `GC.latest_gc_info[key]`.
## malloc_allocated_size() [](#method-c-malloc_allocated_size)
Returns the size of memory allocated by malloc().

Only available if ruby was built with `CALC_EXACT_MALLOC_SIZE`.
**@overload** [] 

## malloc_allocations() [](#method-c-malloc_allocations)
Returns the number of malloc() allocations.

Only available if ruby was built with `CALC_EXACT_MALLOC_SIZE`.
**@overload** [] 

## measure_total_time() [](#method-c-measure_total_time)
call-seq:
    GC.measure_total_time -> true/false

Returns the measure_total_time flag (default: `true`). Note that measurement
can affect the application's performance.
## measure_total_time=(flag ) [](#method-c-measure_total_time=)
call-seq:
    GC.measure_total_time = true/false

Enables measuring GC time. You can get the result with `GC.stat(:time)`. Note
that GC time measurement can cause some performance overhead.
## start(full_mark: true, immediate_mark: true, immediate_sweep: true) [](#method-c-start)
Initiates garbage collection, even if manually disabled.

The `full_mark` keyword argument determines whether or not to perform a major
garbage collection cycle. When set to `true`, a major garbage collection cycle
is run, meaning all objects are marked. When set to `false`, a minor garbage
collection cycle is run, meaning only young objects are marked.

The `immediate_mark` keyword argument determines whether or not to perform
incremental marking. When set to `true`, marking is completed during the call
to this method. When set to `false`, marking is performed in steps that are
interleaved with future Ruby code execution, so marking might not be completed
during this method call. Note that if `full_mark` is `false`, then marking
will always be immediate, regardless of the value of `immediate_mark`.

The `immediate_sweep` keyword argument determines whether or not to defer
sweeping (using lazy sweep). When set to `false`, sweeping is performed in
steps that are interleaved with future Ruby code execution, so sweeping might
not be completed during this method call. When set to `true`, sweeping is
completed during the call to this method.

Note: These keyword arguments are implementation and version-dependent. They
are not guaranteed to be future-compatible and may be ignored if the
underlying implementation does not support them.
## stat(hash_or_key nil) [](#method-c-stat)
call-seq:
    GC.stat -> Hash
    GC.stat(hash) -> Hash
    GC.stat(:key) -> Numeric

Returns a Hash containing information about the GC.

The contents of the hash are implementation-specific and may change in the
future without notice.

The hash includes internal statistics about GC such as:

If the optional argument, hash, is given, it is overwritten and returned. This
is intended to avoid the probe effect.

This method is only expected to work on CRuby.
## stat_heap(heap_name nil, hash_or_key nil) [](#method-c-stat_heap)
call-seq:
    GC.stat_heap -> Hash
    GC.stat_heap(nil, hash) -> Hash
    GC.stat_heap(heap_name) -> Hash
    GC.stat_heap(heap_name, hash) -> Hash
    GC.stat_heap(heap_name, :key) -> Numeric

Returns information for heaps in the GC.

If the first optional argument, `heap_name`, is passed in and not `nil`, it
returns a `Hash` containing information about the particular heap. Otherwise,
it will return a `Hash` with heap names as keys and a `Hash` containing
information about the heap as values.

If the second optional argument, `hash_or_key`, is given as a `Hash`, it will
be overwritten and returned. This is intended to avoid the probe effect.

If both optional arguments are passed in and the second optional argument is a
symbol, it will return a `Numeric` value for the particular heap.

On CRuby, `heap_name` is of the type `Integer` but may be of type `String` on
other implementations.

The contents of the hash are implementation-specific and may change in the
future without notice.

If the optional argument, hash, is given, it is overwritten and returned.

This method is only expected to work on CRuby.

The hash includes the following keys about the internal information in the GC:

slot_size
:   The slot size of the heap in bytes.

heap_allocatable_pages
:   The number of pages that can be allocated without triggering a new garbage
    collection cycle.

heap_eden_pages
:   The number of pages in the eden heap.

heap_eden_slots
:   The total number of slots in all of the pages in the eden heap.

heap_tomb_pages
:   The number of pages in the tomb heap. The tomb heap only contains pages
    that do not have any live objects.

heap_tomb_slots
:   The total number of slots in all of the pages in the tomb heap.

total_allocated_pages
:   The total number of pages that have been allocated in the heap.

total_freed_pages
:   The total number of pages that have been freed and released back to the
    system in the heap.

force_major_gc_count
:   The number of times this heap has forced major garbage collection cycles
    to start due to running out of free slots.

force_incremental_marking_finish_count
:   The number of times this heap has forced incremental marking to complete
    due to running out of pooled slots.

## stress() [](#method-c-stress)
call-seq:
    GC.stress -> integer, true, or false

Returns the current status of GC stress mode.
## stress=(flag ) [](#method-c-stress=)
call-seq:
    GC.stress = flag -> flag

Updates the GC stress mode.

When stress mode is enabled, the GC is invoked at every GC opportunity: all
memory and object allocations.

Enabling stress mode will degrade performance; it is only for debugging.

The flag can be true, false, or an integer bitwise-ORed with the following
flags:
    0x01:: no major GC
    0x02:: no immediate sweep
    0x04:: full mark after malloc/calloc/realloc
## total_time() [](#method-c-total_time)
call-seq:
    GC.total_time -> int

Returns the measured GC total time in nanoseconds.
## verify_compaction_references(*args ) [](#method-c-verify_compaction_references)
Verify compaction reference consistency.

This method is implementation specific.  During compaction, objects that were
moved are replaced with T_MOVED objects.  No object should have a reference to
a T_MOVED object after compaction.

This function expands the heap to ensure room to move all objects, compacts
the heap to make sure everything moves, updates all references, then performs
a full GC.  If any object contains a reference to a T_MOVED object, that
object should be pushed on the mark stack, and will make a SEGV.
**@overload** [] 

## verify_internal_consistency() [](#method-c-verify_internal_consistency)
Verify internal consistency.

This method is implementation specific. Now this method checks generational
consistency if RGenGC is supported.
**@overload** []
